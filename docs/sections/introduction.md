# Introduction

Welcome to the bittide documentation book. bittide is a decentralized synchronization scheme that aims to bring the benefits of single-clock, single-chip design to multiple independently clocked chips at datacenter scale. This book serves as an introduction to bittide and its concepts, bittide-hardware-as-a-library, and the experimentation platform(s) currently in use. Our goal is to provide the necessary information to develop and deploy experiments on bittide-based systems.
