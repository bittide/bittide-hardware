# TODO: Calling cargo here is a workaround for the Shakefile now importing
#       Bittide.Instances.Hitl.Tests which requires Bittide.Instances.Hitl.VexRiscv
#       which uses Template Haskell to read firmware binaries. I.e. Shake can
#       no longer call cargo to build the binaries before they are required.
#       The future goal is to not have the firmware in the FPGA bitstream as
#       described here: https://github.com/bittide/bittide-hardware/issues/502
