{- | Consumes 'SpeedChange's produced by a clock control algorithm and produces a
'RegisterOperation' for the 'si539xSpi' core. Consumption rate of 'SpeedUp's and
'SlowDown' depends on the availability of the SPI core. Uses 'dcFifo' with a depth
of 16 elements for clock domain crossing. This is an alternative to controlling the
FINC / FDEC pins directly, the advantages are that we already have to use SPI
to configure the chips, so we require less wiring / IO, and we don´t have to concern
ourselves with the timing requirements for controlling FINC / FDEC directly. The only
downside is that it  is not as instantaneous as controlling the pins.
