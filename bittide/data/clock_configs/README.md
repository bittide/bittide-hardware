# Clock configs
Clock configurations are built with [ClockBuilder Pro](https://www.skyworksinc.com/Application-Pages/Clockbuilder-Pro-Software). The `.slabtimeproj` can be imported by ClockBuilder Pro, the CSVs can be generated using it. In turn, CSVs can be read by `Bittide.ClockControl.ParseRegisters.parseFromFileToRegisterMap`.
